tickr
~~~~~

there's quite a bunch of SW with that name out there.
this one:
- picks a random picture from a random day out of the daily top500
  of flickr and displays it.
- a tickr.html history file is kept with thumbnails and links to the
  largest format of that image and the flickr URL showing that image.

you have to enter the current year in the source script

this is my 2nd implementation of the same thing. the 1st one was in perl.
but there's also a 3rd implementation which is portable over all posix
shells, but I don't have it here right now. V3 also runs on busybox's ash
alone and is suitable for embedded devices. I will add it once I run over it
in my backup, or my USB keyboard currently at work makes it back home so I
can rip the script of the picture frame hanging on my wall for 4 years now.

jpegsize prints the "X Y MP\n" of the jpg image provided as argument.
jpegsize [ -x | -y | -m ] image.jpg
	print the width and height and megapixels of an image
	-x  print only width
	-y  print only height
	-m  print only megapixels
