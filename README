tickr
~~~~~

there's quite a bunch of SW with that name out there.
this one:
- picks a random picture from a random day out of the daily explore
  page of flickr and displays it.
- a tickr.html history file is kept with thumbnails and links to the
  largest format of that image and the flickr URL showing that image.

I run it on an embedded PC which hangs on my wall with a display
an an ancient baroque style frame.
around end of 2012 flick broke all backward compatibility, an I
fixed it again in tickr.sh

I kept being asked whether I can show some pic of my PC on my picture
frame hanging on the wall. This implementation also allows this by scp'ing
(or whatever) /tmp/remote.jpg and touching a /tmp/remote.tag on the
picture frame.

this implementation is portable over all posix shells. Basically this means
that it also runs on busybox's ash alone and is suitable for embedded devices.

jpegsize prints the "X Y MP\n" of the jpg image provided as argument.
jpegsize [ -x | -y | -m ] image.jpg
	print the width and height and megapixels of an image
	-x  print only width
	-y  print only height
	-m  print only megapixels
